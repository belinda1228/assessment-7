The push function scales better and performs better in terms of 
amount of time it consumed. Amount of time doubled when push function is 
used when the input is 10 times larger; whereas, function unshift 
consumered more than double amount of time when the input is 10 times larger.
This is being observed based on how each function generates end result.

The reason why the function unshift is a lot slower than the function push
is that when push is performed, operating time is constant 1; whereas, when unshift 
is performed, operating time is not constant but it's amount of numbers already in the array
